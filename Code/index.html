          Hospitals complement and amplify the effectiveness of many other parts
          of the health system, providing continuous availability of services
          for acute and complex conditions. They concentrate scarce resources
          within well-planned referral networks to respond efficiently to
          population health needs. They are an essential element of Universal
          Health Coverage (UHC) and will be critical to meeting the Sustainable
          Development Goals (SDG). Hospitals are also an essential part of
          health system development. Currently, external pressures, health
          systems shortcomings and hospital sector deficiencies are driving a
          new vision for hospitals in many parts of the world. In this vision,
          they have a key role to play to support other healthcare providers and
          for community outreach and home-based services and are essential in a
          well-functioning referral network. Hospitals matter to people and
          often mark central points in their lives. They also matter to health
          systems by being instrumental for care coordination and integration.
          They often provide a setting for education of doctors, nurses and
          other health-care professionals and are a critical base for clinical
          research.
